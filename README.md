## Description

*Data fixtures for pytest made simple*

Offers fixtures for your tests to simplify data fixtures access.
Makes use of Python's native `Path` objects.

Data fixtures (files) expected to be stored in `datafixtures` directory next to your test modules:
```
    tests
    |-- datafixtures
    |-- test_basic.py
    |
    |-- subdirectory
    |---- datafixtures
    |---- test_other.py
```


## Requirements

* Python 3.10+


## Fixtures

* `datafix_dir` - Path object for data fixtures directory from the current test module's directory.
* `datafix` - Path object for a file in data fixtures directory with the same name as the current test function.
* `datafix_read` - Returns text contents of a data fixture by name.
* `datafix_readbin` - Returns binary contents of a data fixture by name.


#### datafix_dir

Access data fixtures directory:

```python
def test_me(datafix_dir):

    # datafix_dir returns a Path object.
    assert datafix_dir.exists()

    # Gather data fixtures filenames.
    files = list(f'{file.name}' for file in datafix_dir.iterdir())

    # Read some fixture as text.
    # The same as using `datafix_read` fixture (see below).
    filecontent = (datafix_dir / 'expected.html').read_text()

    # Or read binary.
    filecontent = (datafix_dir / 'dumped.bin').read_bytes()
```

#### datafix

Access a data fixture with test name:

```python
def test_me(datafix):
    # Read datafixtures/test_me.txt file
    filecontents = datafix.with_suffix('.txt').read_text()
```

#### datafix_read

Access text contents of a data fixture by name:

```python
def test_datafix_read(datafix_read):
    # Read datafixtures/expected.html file
    filecontents = datafix_read('expected.html')

    # Read encoded and represent as an StringIO object.
    encoded_io = datafix_read('test_datafix.txt', encoding='cp1251', io=True)
```

#### datafix_readbin

Access binary contents of a data fixture by name:

```python
    def test_datafix_read(datafix_readbin):
        # Read datafixtures/dumped.bin file
        binary = datafix_readbin('dumped.bin')

        # Read binary and represent as an BytesIO object.
        bin_io = datafix_readbin('dumped.bin', io=True)
```
